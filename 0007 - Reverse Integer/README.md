Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return 0.

# Example 1:

```yaml
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

# Example 2:

```yaml
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

# Example 3:

```yaml
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

# Constraints:

```yaml
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
```
